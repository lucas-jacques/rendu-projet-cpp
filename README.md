# C++ projects

## Lucas Chabiron & Lucas Jacques

After studying the amount of work required for each project, we decided to divide the tasks equally by taking one project each. For each projects we used git & github for versionning. We each reviewed each other's code in order to fully understand both projects and fix errors. For the challenge
In order to challenge ourselves, we chose projects number 5 and 6. 

## You can find both of our projects in these two repos:

- [Enigma](https://github.com/lucaschabiron/TP5_cpp)
- [SudokuSolver](https://github.com/lucas-jacques/Sudoku)

Each repository has a README.md that contains what we have learned about each project. Feel free to explore the code that is documented, or to test our programs.
